    "- Given the time and resource constraints in the context of this assignment, the error seems reasonable, but requires further improvements in future.\n",

    "- On the positive side, by looking at the CV folds errors of the best LightGBM model, the model seem stable (with std of test scores ~ 978) \n",
    "\n",
    "- Given that the range of the target variable (median_house_value) is 500000-15000 = 485000 (see EDA), then the 45000 error is roughly 10% of the range, which might be acceptable.\n",
